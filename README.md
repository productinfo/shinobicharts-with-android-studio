# Using ShinobiCharts with Android Studio

This repo includes a sample project which has been configured to enable users to
build apps which use ShinobiCharts for Android using Android Studio.

It definitely works with Android Studio 0.3.6, but since Android Studio is currently
in an early access preview state, expect it to break in upcoming releases.

The accompanying writeup will explain the steps to recreate this project, starting
from scratch to enable you to create your own projects.
